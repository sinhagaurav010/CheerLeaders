/*
 Icons/banner ads are blurry can we do higher res or not force image size  don't worry because We are sending you new icons without the stripes anyway?
 
 *Events icon is supposed to have the iC On The Scene verbage and not the calendar still says newsletter up top
 
 *The app name in iTunes is wrong….they just want it to say Inside Cheer because of space….but now it says Inside Cheerleader…which is wrong anyway.
 
 *Gallery pics are skewed…..and they prefer doing a thumbnail as opposed to a slideshow.  Additionally, the slide show only had ten covers….and they gave us dozens.  we need them all to show.
 
 *Background behind menu….they decided no gradient just white.
 
 *IC banner ad they think might be the iPad one….they claim it looks skewed
