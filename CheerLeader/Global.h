 Changes mail : 05May2012
 1.      On social network make background white
 
 2.      Rename Bottom blog button to Events
 
 3.      Redo Gallery like image I just sent you
 
 
 
 2 questions.
 
 
 
 1. Is it possible that when a new blog is posted in the buzz it send a push notification? (If not thats ok just curious)
 
 2. How can we show images in the rss feeds for buzz and events is this something we can do in formatting on our end?
 
 //////////////////
 
 
 Icons/banner ads are blurry can we do higher res or not force image size  don't worry because We are sending you new icons without the stripes anyway?
 OK done.
 
 *Events icon is supposed to have the iC On The Scene verbage and not the calendar still says newsletter up top
 Done
 
 *The app name in iTunes is wrong….they just want it to say Inside Cheer because of space….but now it says Inside Cheerleader…which is wrong anyway.
 Done
 
 *Gallery pics are skewed…..and they prefer doing a thumbnail as opposed to a slideshow.  Additionally, the slide show only had ten covers….and they gave us dozens.  we need them all to show.
 
 
 *Background behind menu….they decided no gradient just white.
 Done
 
 *IC banner ad they think might be the iPad one….they claim it looks skewed
 Done
