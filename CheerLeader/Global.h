 //Changes mail:15May2012
 1.) I've attached the image for the load screen. After the load screen
 they would like it to go directly into "top stories"
 Done
 
 
 2.) "Top stories" should be built in a framework.  The app should pull
 content into the app & structure the content sop that it is mobile
 optimized. ( see attached image titled top stories mock)
 Done
 
 
 3.) They would like their white logo at the top where it  currently says
 Inside Cheerleading (logo attached) instead of generic text that says
 Inside Cheerleading
 Done
 
 
 4.)  logo in the ad for the Subscribe today is out of proportion (please
 fix)
 Done
 
 
 5.) They have 49 Inside Cheerleading covers for the gallery (see
 attached gallery zip file)
 Please make sure that the images are not skewed. (all gallery covers are
 in order in the zip file, please keep them in order)
 
 
 6.) I have attached a zip file with all of the correct icons for the
 app: (In the zip there are several versions of each icon so that you can
 use the correct one for each device including the new iPad with Retna
 Display)
 
 Please click link for explanation:

 tual/MobileHIG/IconsImages/IconsImages.html
 
 
 7.) Title of the App should be "Inside Cheer" which appears on the
 bottom of the screen on an iPhone
 Done
 
 
 8.) The banner Ad for inside cheerleading needs to go to their website
 http://insidecheerleading.com....it currently is going to high level
 studios.Done
 
 
 9. )I am getting higher resolution banner ads from the client, I will
 get these to you as soon as I can.

 Changes mail : 05May2012
 1.      On social network make background white
 
 2.      Rename Bottom blog button to Events
 
 3.      Redo Gallery like image I just sent you
 
 
 
 2 questions.
 
 
 
 1. Is it possible that when a new blog is posted in the buzz it send a push notification? (If not thats ok just curious)
 
 2. How can we show images in the rss feeds for buzz and events is this something we can do in formatting on our end?
 
 //////////////////
 
 
 Icons/banner ads are blurry can we do higher res or not force image size  don't worry because We are sending you new icons without the stripes anyway?
 OK done.
 
 *Events icon is supposed to have the iC On The Scene verbage and not the calendar still says newsletter up top
 Done
 
 *The app name in iTunes is wrong….they just want it to say Inside Cheer because of space….but now it says Inside Cheerleader…which is wrong anyway.
 Done
 
 *Gallery pics are skewed…..and they prefer doing a thumbnail as opposed to a slideshow.  Additionally, the slide show only had ten covers….and they gave us dozens.  we need them all to show.
 
 
 *Background behind menu….they decided no gradient just white.
 Done
 
 *IC banner ad they think might be the iPad one….they claim it looks skewed
 Done
